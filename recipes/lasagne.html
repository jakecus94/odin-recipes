    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Illo cupiditate saepe eum, officia culpa asperiores. Iste maiores quos sit fugit.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
<ul>
    
        <li>500g Beef Mince</li>
        <li>1 can of chopped tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 Beef Stock Cube</li>
        <li>1 Onion</li>
        <li>1 Celery Stick</li>
        <li>1 Carrot</li>
        <li> 3 cloves of Garlic</li>
        <li> Boat load of cheese</li>
</ul>

    <h2>Method</h2>

    <ol>

        <li>Saute pancetta in a large stockpot over medium-high heat until fat has rendered, 1 to 2 minutes. Add carrot, celery, onion, and oil. Cook and stir until vegetables have softened and onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add beef and pork. Cook, stirring and mashing meat into small crumbles, until browned, 5 to 7 minutes more.</li>

        <li>Stir wine into the stockpot and bring to a boil. Add tomato sauce and stir; pour in 1 cup broth. Reduce heat to low and partially cover the pot to allow steam to escape. Simmer sauce for 1 hour, stirring occasionally.</li>
    
        <li>Pour 1 more cup of broth into the sauce. Continue simmering until thick, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Add more broth only if absolutely necessary; ragu should drop, not run, off a spoon.</li>
    
        <li>Start preparing pasta after sauce has been cooking for 1 1/2 hours. Bring water and salt to a boil in a small saucepan. Add spinach and cover until it returns to a boil. Stir gently and cook until spinach is heated through. Remove from heat, leave covered, and let cool.</li>
    
        <li>Drain spinach in a mesh strainer set over a bowl, pressing it down with a fork to squeeze out as much water and possible; reserve the liquid. Puree spinach in a blender until smooth.</li>
    
        <li>Sift flour into a bowl. Make a well in the center; add eggs, spinach, and about 1 tablespoon of the reserved liquid. Mix together by hand or using the dough hook of a stand mixer, adding more liquid if needed. Knead until dough becomes a smooth ball. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.</li>
    
        <li>Taste the ragu and adjust salt. Remove from heat and add milk; stir well and set aside to cool.</li>
    
        <li>Divide pasta dough into 4 equal sections. Use a pasta machine, or rolling pin, dusted with flour, to roll pasta into 1/16-inch thick sheets. Lay sheets on clean dish towels to help them dry. Let rest for 20 minutes.</li>
    
        <li>Meanwhile, melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Do not allow it to brown or burn. Add flour and whisk constantly until golden. Add 1/2 cup milk, whisking constantly. Repeat with remaining milk. Simmer until bechamel is thickened, about 10 minutes. Season with nutmeg and salt.</li>
    
       <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
